# BougainvilleStudio V2
Bougainville is an ambitious cultural project which aims to bring together text, picture and video to tell the incredible and famous tale of Captain Hautbrave in his exploration and discoveries of deep space, astonishing planets, and foreign cultures

## This is the second version of the Bougainville project
With Epitech I learned a thing or two and improved drastically my personal project, although there's still a lot of work, of course.

### Backend:

- [nodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express] (https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongooDB-Atlas] (https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

### Frontend:

- [ReactJS] (https://reactjs.org/)

## Start the project
First, you'll need to get the git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/EdPaillard/BougainvilleStudio_v2.git [YOUR FOLDER]
```

Then, step into the project folder you just created...
```
cd [YOUR FOLDER]
```

... and start the whole thing:
```
docker-compose up
```

You can now navigate on the site on
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploy version WIP Github test
